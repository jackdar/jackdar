### Hello! üëã

- Neovim using <a href="https://www.github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim">nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim</a> as a base configuration and developing my own <a href="https://www.github.com/jackdar/jack.nvim">configuration<a>.

#### What I'm focusing on üßë‚Äçüíª
For the last two years I have focused mainly on learning and working with the C and Java programming languages.\
At the end of 2023 I ended up working heavily with C# using it to develop a small <a href="https://www.github.com/PigTopia">2D multiplayer game in Unity</a>.

However, my current focus is to upskill in the area of modern full-stack development using tools such as ReactJS, NodeJS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Go generally to be able to build web applications.

I am also learning a new development environment which focuses on the use of tools such as <a href="https://www.github.com/jackdar/jack.nvim">Neovim</a> and Tmux.
