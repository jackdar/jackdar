### What I'm focusing on :technologist:

For the last two years I have focused mainly on learning and working with the C and Java programming languages.\
At the end of last year I ended up working heavily with C# using it to develop a small <a href="https://www.github.com/PigTopia">2D multiplayer game in Unity</a>.

However, my current focus is to upskill in the area of full-stack development using tools such as ReactJS, NodeJS, and JavaScript generally to be able to build modern web apps.
